# Task Manager

This is a simple task manager application built with Express.js and MongoDB. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on tasks.

## Features

- **Create:** Users can create new tasks.
- **Read:** Users can view existing tasks.
- **Update:** Users can update existing tasks.
- **Delete:** Users can delete tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing task data.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Nodemon:** A utility that automatically restarts the server when changes are detected in the code.

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for better organization:

- **Model:** Contains the schema definitions and interacts with the database using Mongoose.
- **View:** Not applicable for this project as it's a backend application.
- **Controller:** Handles the logic for processing HTTP requests and responses.
- **Middleware:** Contains custom middleware functions, including error handling and async programming.
- **Routes:** Defines the routes and their corresponding controller functions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide the connection URI in the configuration.
4. Start the server using `npm start` or `nodemon`.

## API Endpoints
